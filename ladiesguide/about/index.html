        A podcast seeing movies through the eyes of two ladies (“The time for this podcast is now”), fan reviews call it “binge-worthy”, “reading my mind”, “super fun, funny and light hearted” and “this podcast has changed how I talk about movies with everyone”.</p>

        <p>Movie ratings are rounded down to the nearest half star. Recommended movies are any movies with at least one rating of 4 or more stars. Horny and date movies are any movies deemed horny or date worthy, respectively, by at least one reviewer. Horny and date movies marked with hesitancy (,but...) should be taken with a degree of caution (only specific circumstances apply, few and far between applications, etc). Patreon episodes released to the main feed are listed as their original release on Patreon.</p>

            <h4>David Lang is a VCD graduate from Eastern Washington University, and is currently working at EWU's bookstore as their reliable graphics assistant, creating advertisements in a variety of formats including motion, social media, TV, and in store signage and posters. He is also working at Spokane Regional Transportation Council as their Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and design intern, creating web maps and promotional material for the agency. While at Eastern the first time around obtaining a degree in geography, he worked at the campusâ€™ sole design computer lab, helping students with prepress production and other issues, from complex design projects to simple paper prints. David is originally from Seattle, Washington and is looking to move back to western Washington or western Oregon with his husband and two cats when he graduates again in December 2018. He is looking forward to applying his love for design, video, and motion to his career.</h4>

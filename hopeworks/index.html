    <p>Thanks for taking the time to peak over my portfolio! I've gathered a strong handful of projects below that I believe best reflect my overall skillset and applicability for your graphic designer &amp; digital content specialist position. Feel free to ask me any questions about these projects or others.</p>
    <div id="one">
        <h2>Ranger Tugs R-43 S/CB features and specifications sheet</h2>

        <img src="/audienz/img/2023-R43-Spec-Sheet-Digital4.jpg" alt="R-43 spec sheet page 4">
        <p>An undertaking described during onboarding at Fluid Motion, I was tasked with redesigning the printed feature and specification sheets for around 20 different boats across two brands. First up was the R-43 Sedan/Command Bridge, the flagship of the Ranger Tugs line. Here, I provided a larger sense of flow between pages (the first and last are printed on the same side of a tabloid sheet, ditto for the second and third images), a stronger form of uniformity and organization, and a unique visual identity for the brand. Only the spec sheet for the R-43 is currently published, however, the other Ranger Tugs and all Cutwater Boats spec sheets are in their final draft stages.</p>

        <h2>Angel Of The Winds Casino Resort table games informational/how to play touchscreen</h2>

        <img src="/audienz/img/Tables%20Touch%20Setup.png" alt="Screenshot of Brightsigns showcasing touchscreen links">
        <p>Asked to design new informational touchscreens for most venues at the casino, the table games touchscreen proved to be the most intense. Between creating a unique style that matched elements of the casino as a whole and the table games specifically, accurately (and legally) applying the game rules to each page, and linking the screens correctly between them all, it proved to be a complex assignment.</p>

    <div id="three">
        <h2>Lunar New Year Concert - 2020</h2>
        <img src="/audienz/img/LunarNYconcert-POSTER.jpg" alt="Lunar New Year concert poster">
        <p>At the end of 2019, Angel Of The Winds was the last casino in the area to book and advertise a musical guest for the Lunar Near Year (in January 2020). Once booked, I was tasked with quickly coming up with a unique look that stood out from the other casino's campaigns - dominated by red and gold coloring - that had already been live for at least a month. Right out of the gate, I drew inspiration from East Asian watercolor paintings and plums - both in the trees and literal color.</p>

    <div id="four">
        <h2>Xpansion Grand Opening passport</h2>
        <img src="/audienz/img/GrandOpeningPassport-10x10-1.jpg" alt="Grand Opening Passport booklet - stamp side">
        <img src="/audienz/img/GrandOpeningPassport-10x10-2.jpg" alt="Grand Opening Passport booklet - map side">
        <img src="/audienz/img/passport-folded.jpg" alt="Photo of Grand Opening Passport with folds">
        <p>After several delays, the "Xpansion" at Angel Of The Winds was formally unveiled in late summer 2019. For the opening, the experience was gamified to engage patrons to visit all the new venues and collect potential rewards from raffles. I was tasked with creating the "passport" brochure, with stamping areas and map.</p>

        <h2>Collectable Game Day buttons - 2018</h2>

        <img src="/audienz/img/buttons.jpg" alt="Collectable Game Day buttons">
        <p>An annual tradtion for EWU Eagle Store design interns, I was tasked with creating unique buttons for the Fall 2018 football season, in addition to additional collateral to advertise the promotion.</p>

        <h2>The Rocky Planets - motion visualization</h2>
        <div id="video">
            <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/294009776?h=89ace4e8fa&color=e6e6e6&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
        </div>
        <p>Yep, that is my own narration! In my motion design class at Eastern Washington University, we were taked with creating a educational visualization of at least a minute in length. Beyond its slick visual look, I took extra attention to minor details - such as accurate planet sizes in transitions - and added a dollop of humor in as well (subjective).</p>
